## What is Veil Strike?

Veil Strike is a **zero-knowledge prediction market protocol** built on **Aleo**. Users bet on real-world outcomes — crypto prices, sports, politics, science — with **full privacy** powered by ZK proofs. The protocol uses a **Fixed Product Market Maker (FPMM)**, supports three tokens (ALEO, USDCx, USAD), features **Strike Rounds** with 15-minute auto-resolved cycles (3 concurrent slots: BTC-ALEO, ETH-ALEO, ALEO-ALEO) using delegated proving, and includes a 12-hour dispute window for event markets.

Every trade generates a zero-knowledge proof. Your identity, position size, and payout are encrypted on-chain — only you can decrypt them.

## Smart Contracts

Three independent Leo programs deployed on Aleo Testnet — split to stay under the 2.1M variable limit.

### Program IDs

| Program | Token | Transitions | Deploy TX |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `veil_strike_v6.aleo` | ALEO + Governance | 17 | `at1459u3ehmatrnk8huk5wj4dtfw668fml6kga62rkw0m4wpnfrxvqs79ey84` |
| `veil_strike_v6_cx.aleo` | USDCx | 15 | `at1g4py5xd8htpnalkm07axnahp5gyxj57jgm5cj9dqfxeeqckdzs8qpguzw9` |
| `veil_strike_v6_sd.aleo` | USAD | 15 | `at1yupukl8wynnu748u95scnqztqk33nwema3lxy7dfw7jm694cucyshswksx` |

### Transitions Overview

#### veil_strike_v6.aleo — ALEO Market + Governance (17)

| # | Transition | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `open_market` | Create ALEO prediction market with initial liquidity |
| 2 | `acquire_shares` | Buy outcome shares (private credits in, private shares out) |
| 3 | `dispose_shares` | Sell shares back to AMM (private shares in, private credits out) |
| 4 | `fund_pool` | Add liquidity to AMM pool (returns encrypted LP token) |
| 5 | `lock_market` | Close market after trading deadline |
| 6 | `render_verdict` | Submit initial resolution with winning outcome |
| 7 | `ratify_verdict` | Finalize after 12-hour challenge window |
| 8 | `void_market` | Cancel market (creator or emergency) |
| 9 | `flash_settle` | **Strike Rounds** — instant resolver-only settlement (no challenge) |
| 10 | `contest_verdict` | Dispute resolution with 5 ALEO bond |
| 11 | `recover_bond` | Reclaim dispute bond after finalization |
| 12 | `harvest_winnings` | Redeem winning shares for ALEO |
| 13 | `harvest_refund` | Claim refund from cancelled market |
| 14 | `withdraw_pool` | Remove LP liquidity (after resolution) |
| 15 | `harvest_fees` | Withdraw accumulated creator fees |
| 16 | `submit_proposal` | Create on-chain governance proposal |
| 17 | `cast_vote` | Vote on governance proposal |

#### veil_strike_v6_cx.aleo (USDCx) · veil_strike_v6_sd.aleo (USAD) — 15 each
Same market flow as the main program but handling USDCx and USAD respectively. Missing: `flash_settle`, `submit_proposal`, `cast_vote` (governance lives in main program only).

### Key Constants

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Protocol fee | 0.5% |
| Creator fee | 0.5% |
| LP fee | 1.0% |
| Total fee | 2.0% |
| Challenge window | 2,880 blocks (~12 hours) |
| Min trade | 0.01 ALEO |
| Min liquidity | 1 ALEO |
| Min dispute bond | 5 ALEO |

### Privacy Model

| What | Privacy |
|------|---------|
| Trader identity | 🟢 Private — ZK-encrypted via `transfer_private_to_public` |
| Position sizes | 🟢 Private — `OutcomeShare` encrypted record |
| LP positions | 🟢 Private — `LPToken` encrypted record |
| ALEO payouts | 🟢 Private — `transfer_public_to_private` output |
| Dispute bonds | 🟢 Private — `DisputeBondReceipt` encrypted record |
| Market state | 🔴 Public — required for fair AMM pricing |
| Winning outcome | 🔴 Public — revealed at finalization |
| USDCx deposits | 🟡 Public — compliance token limitation (payout is private) |

## User Flows

### Event Prediction Market Flow

```
1. Admin/User: open_market(question_hash, category, num_outcomes, deadline, resolver, liquidity, nonce)
   → Returns: market_id (field), LPToken (private record)

2. User: acquire_shares(market_id, outcome, amount_in, expected_shares, share_nonce, credits_record)
   → Returns: OutcomeShare (private record) — no one sees what you bet or how much

3. [Market deadline passes]

4. Resolver: lock_market(market_id)
5. Resolver: render_verdict(market_id, winning_outcome)
   → Sets 12-hour challenge window

6. Anyone: contest_verdict(market_id, proposed_outcome, dispute_nonce, credits_record)
   → Bond of 5 ALEO locked in DisputeBondReceipt

7. [12 hours pass with no valid dispute OR dispute resolved]

8. Anyone: ratify_verdict(market_id)
   → Market finalized, winners can claim

9. Winner: harvest_winnings(outcome_share, expected_payout)
   → Receives private ALEO credits (1:1 for winning outcome)

10. LP: withdraw_pool(lp_token, expected_amount)
    → Receives private ALEO credits (pro-rata + LP fees)
```

### Strike Round Flow (automated via Round Bot)

```
1. Round Bot: open_market(question="BTC Strike Round #N", num_outcomes=2, resolver=bot)
   → Delegated proving (~30s via Provable API). Oracle records start price.
   → 3 concurrent slots: BTC/ALEO, ETH/ALEO, ALEO/ALEO

2. User: acquire_shares(market_id, outcome=1or2, amount, ...)
   → Encrypted OutcomeShare record (UP or DOWN position)
   → 40-second cooldown before next bet (prevents UTXO reuse errors)

3. [15-minute round timer expires]
   → Frontend shows "Settling..." with progress info

4. Round Bot: compare oracle start vs end price → flash_settle via delegated proving
   → ALL markets settled on-chain (including empty ones — ensures clean state)
   → Settlement takes ~5 min (3 settles + 3 creates, each ~20-50s DPS)

5. Round Bot: creates next round automatically (open_market with new nonce + start price)
   → Scanner indexes it and the new round appears in /rounds

6. Winner: harvest_winnings(outcome_share, expected_payout)
   → Receives private ALEO credits (1:1)

Manual override: Admin can still resolve any market via /admin page + wallet flash_settle.
```

### Governance Flow

```
1. User: submit_proposal(action_type, target_market, amount, recipient, token_type, deadline, nonce)
   → Returns: GovernanceReceipt (private record proving vote weight)

2. Others: cast_vote(proposal_id, support=true/false)
   → Returns: GovernanceReceipt per voter

3. [Deadline passes, quorum reached]

4. Protocol executes approved action (resolver approval, fee update, treasury withdrawal)
```

**Action Types:**
- `0` General proposal
- `1` Approve resolver address
- `2` Treasury withdrawal
- `3` Fee update
- `4` Market override

> ⚠️ Governance is live on-chain but still evolving. Quorum requirements, timelock, and execution logic will be improved in future waves.

## Resolution

The resolver address (`aleo19za49scmhufst9q8lhwka5hmkvzx5ersrue3gjwcs705542daursptmx0r`) is the only address authorized to call `flash_settle` and `render_verdict`.

### Automated Round Bot — Strike Rounds
The `services/round-bot.ts` automates the full Strike Round lifecycle using **delegated proving** (Provable API):
1. Creates 3 concurrent markets on startup (BTC-ALEO, ETH-ALEO, ALEO-ALEO)
2. Every 15 minutes, the round timer expires
3. Bot compares oracle start vs end price → `flash_settle` via delegated proving (~30s)
4. ALL markets are settled on-chain, including empty ones (ensures clean state)
5. Bot immediately creates the next round
6. Smart recovery on restart: bot adopts existing active rounds (prevents duplicates); expired/transient slots reset to idle
7. Settle retry limit: max 3 failures before skipping round and moving on

### Manual Override (`/admin`)
Admin can still resolve any market manually via the `/admin` page — wallet signs `flash_settle` directly.

### Backend Auto-Resolver — Event Markets Only
The `services/auto-resolver.ts` cron runs every 2 minutes and handles event market lifecycle:
- Stage 1 (past deadline): calls `close_market` automatically (uses backend `RESOLVER_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- Stage 2 (closed): calls `render_verdict` automatically
- Stage 3 (past 2,880-block challenge window): calls `ratify_verdict` automatically

### Delegated Proving
Both the round bot and the proof dispatcher use the **Provable API** for delegated proving. Authorization is built locally (~1s), then the ZK proof is generated on Provable's servers (~15-30s) and broadcast to the network. This replaces the previous local proving (2-5 min) and enables automated sub-minute round resolution.
